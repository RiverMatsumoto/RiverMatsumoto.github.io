I have enjoyed Javascript so far. I like that there are multiple ways to do things for people who are more comfortable with different styles, although I could see that being a styleÂ issue when collaborating with others since you need to specify some standardized style guidelines yourself. Compared to C# and C/C++, languages I am more comfortable with, it feels more like a scripting language that just works. I learned some new things from ES6 like destructuring, promises, and some other syntax specific to JS.



From a software engineering perspective, the fact that it lets you structure your code in almost anyway you want could be an issue if you want to read through someone else's code. More structure when working with other people is nice because you can be more efficient when reading and understanding code which is extremely important. As an interpreted language, javascript is probably not suited towards building large scalable applications since for the most part, you would need to find bugs at runtime or through tests which is very time consuming. Even though Javascript might have some flaws or things I dislike, I need to accept them for now and move on with learning more.
