I was fascinated by software when I first started learning game development in 2020 during the pandemic. The first week when I was learning C# for unity, I studied from moment the sun rose until sundown for a week. This is not an exaggeration. I dreamed in code for a while but that quickly went away after my obsession calmed down. Software architecture and design has always interested me and that is why near the beginning I was interested in how people planned out and wrote out their software. It's easy to say you can program when completing Leetcode mediums and hards, but planning software and designing it is a whole different beast.

My interest in larger scale software led me to learning about design patterns and clean code early on. While learning about this advice, I followed the rules and listened to them very closely. However, near my sophomore year of college in 2022, I moved further away from them in favor of quick prototyping and proof of concept which would then lead to me refactoring what I need to. When focusing on anything other than "making it work," I feel like I get diminishing returns. As of now, I feel like I need to just code more and become a real expert as fast as I can. I believe it will only help my career.

In the future, I would like to work on interesting problems. I am not attached to a specific field or company as of now. Even if I did work at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc, if I didn't work on interesting problems, I would want to quit. This is why I enjoy working with the Robotics Space Exploration Lab at UH Manoa. The problems and research they work on is intellectually challenging and it allows me to develop skills for anywhere I may work in the future.

One day, I hope to find myself in a position where I am challenging and testing myself everyday on interesting problems.
