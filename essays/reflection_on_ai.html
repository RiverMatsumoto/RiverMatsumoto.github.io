  <h2 id="ai-will-change-a-lot-of-software-engineering-endeavors">AI will change a lot of software engineering endeavors</h2>
<p>Software engineering as we know it will change for a lot of people. Anything below a certain complexity like smaller programs, toy problems, and frequently solved problems will be solvable by anyone who knows how to use AI such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. AI can sometimes completely solve a problem, but most of the time, you will use it to learn and be given more context on a certain topic. The main AI tools I used were ChatGPT and Github Copilot. Although, Copilot’s main use for me was to speed write a piece of simple code that would have otherwise taken more time for me to write such as a simple for loop, or templates for a class.</p>

<p>Next I want to go over how I have used these tools…</p>

<h2 id="how-i-have-used-or-not-used-ai-for-the-following-topics">How I have used or not used AI for the following topics:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Experience WODs e.g. E18
I decided to not use AI for nearly all the experiences because most of them gave me a good template on how to solve the problem at hand. The most I would ever have it do is to explain why the syntax is a certain way, or what exactly a piece of code was doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-class Practice WODs
I didn’t use AI for the practice WODs because for the most part, all the WODs were simple enough to solve with the basics. There usually weren’t any tricks you needed to know that AI could help with and it was more so understanding the fundamentals of concepts like CSS, Javascript, React, and Meteor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-class WODs
The few times that I found AI to be useful was for creating some HTML layouts and some bootstrap styles to work off of. After that I would add and remove what was needed. AI seems to do a good job of figuring out how to create simple layouts like columns or rows of items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essays
I never used AI for essays. The essays are only meaningful when coming from the person directly and because AI can’t read our mind, anything it writes is likely not what we as students are thinking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Final project
I used ChatGPT for a lot of simple directions on building things with meteor. Most of the issues for me stemmed from missing a single variable that I forgot to rename or add.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning a concept / tutorial
I think this is where AI shines. I like to use tutorial transcripts as a way to dig a bit deeper into the topics being discussed. Sometimes the tutorial skims over something I didn’t quite understand and I can feed that topic into ChatGPT to learn a little more about it. It is amazing for getting introduced to a topic that you have never heard of before, but I still take some of it with a grain of salt especially for technical topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Answering a question in class or in Discord
If I don’t know a question in class or in Discord, I usually don’t try to answer. I also don’t use the class discord as much so I don’t catch questions very fast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asking or answering a smart-question
I have never thought about using AI for asking a smart question, but I think it could be a good idea. However, unless there is a general template for a smart question, I think AI will have trouble getting at the heart of the question you want to ask if even you don’t know the question you want to ask.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
This is another example of a great use of AI. ChatGPT gives great code examples for library functions and I have used it many times to understand better how Meteor works and how to use some react components and bootstrap styles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explaining code
This is quite similar to the coding examples, but I sometimes feed ChatGPT code written for meteor to understand better what is happening. CSS styling is also sometimes difficult to read, although I found that having bootstrap documentation up is faster than throwing it into ChatGPT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing code
I don’t use ChatGPT to write code and I usually use it to learn concepts. However, Copilot is great for writing out simple templates in HTML, CSS, and Javascript/React. The only thing to keep in mind is that Copilot will not usually solve problems, they will usually only create a template for you to work with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documenting code
I haven’t thought about using AI to document code, but I think that the intent of code is best written by the developer themselves since they should understand the code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here="">” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here="">”
I have found that AI in this manner is generally a waste of time. Linters are best when using a lint checker which has strict rules that the AI model needs to know. Asking what's wrong with code usually gives the wrong answer unless it is a syntax error.</code></code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I have used AI on some bootstrap documentation to summarize the most common use cases to get a big picture idea for when to use certain styles. It has helped with viewing things from a higher level.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="impact-on-learning-and-understanding">Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>

<p>AI has helped tremendously with learning and understanding concepts. After using AI, I feel that using search engines take up a lot more time and also takes more deliberate and specific searches. Making the search for information faster and more seamless has saved a lot of time and also makes it feel more enjoyable because a lot of knowledge gaps that might take hours to fill can take only a few minutes because AI seems to summarize concepts generally well.</p>

<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h2>
<p>I think one great practical use of AI is code templating. For example C++ syntax can take some time to write out, but AI can template out a class or simple program very quickly and as the developer it is your job to read the code and move things around to get it to work. I have used AI for some robotics applications where there was a lot of boilerplate C++ code that needed to be written and it helped tremendously with tricky referencing details that would have otherwise taken time for me.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-opportunities">Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<p>In general, I think this course allows for some great opportunities to use AI, but there are times where AI is able to solve very simple problems instantly. I think that in some cases for the purposes of learning, AI can prevent learning opportunities because if it can instantly solve the problem on its own, then the developer or student will have the chance to not learn something fundamental. Especially in 314 where we are expected to learn software engineering fundamentals, it can be challenging to ensure that students learn some content.</p>

<h2 id="comparative-analysis">Comparative Analysis</h2>
<p>One of the amazing things that an AI assistant provides you is the presence of a knowledgeable mentor and iteration. Sometimes when speaking to professors or classmates, it takes a lot of time to get a response, but by prompting an AI model that knows how to solve the problem or point out issues in your code, it feels iterative. I think that students learn the best when you can iterate on a problem over and over and keep improving something. In the same way that an academic paper will always be very poor on the first draft, code will be poor in the first draft and an AI mentor can point out any issues that might come in the future if someone looked at that code again.</p>

<h2 id="future-considerations">Future Considerations</h2>
<p>I think that in its current state, AI has increased the skill floor for software developers. People can learn a lot faster and output more code than ever before. The main issues that I see happening are that newbies will use AI as a crutch to get them past problems while not learning the content themselves. On the other hand, I think that more experienced developers will use efficiently use AI as a tool in a manner where they are both learning and being efficient with their time.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really enjoy the presence of AI and it makes development a bit more fast paced for me. However, I am unsure of the future of software development positions and I think that it will become a tool that people use to create rapid iterations of software and to create boilerplate code. AI has taught me a lot and I hope that as I get better at using AI, that it becomes a valuable asset in my skillset.</p>
