## The Problem

Students sometimes have trouble communicating and collaborating with classmates in the same course as them, especially for those who are in large or online courses. While the Laulima provides the essential tools for assignment submission and resource access, they lack real-time communication features. Currently, students use different apps such as third-party chat apps like Discord, or group messages which can be difficult to coordinate with others in the class.

## The Solution

To solve this issue, our app aims to integrate a chat and homework server that syncs with Laulima and Star. The app creates a place where students enrolled in the same class can collaborate in real-time, share resources, and discuss homework assignments. By connecting students of the same course together, the app enhances the overall learning experience, streamlines homework collaboration, and creates a sense of community among students.

## Mockup Page Ideas

1. **Landing Page**
2. **Dashboard**: Shows a list of enrolled classes, upcoming assignments, and chat notifications
3. **Classroom Page**: An integrated view that includes the class chat, resources, and assignments
4. **Chat page**: Real-time chat with options for private messages and group chats based on topics
5. **Assignment Page**: List of assignments with due dates, statuses, and links to resources.
6. **User Page**: Display student information
7. **Admin Page**: For management of the app

## Use Case Ideas

1. **Homework Collaboration**: Share ideas, resources, and divide tasks for group assignments.
2. **Document Sharing**: Share lecture notes, slides, or other documents
3. **Centralized Class Discussion**: Centralized place for all additional reading materials, past exams, and other resources.

## Beyond the Basics

1. **AI Tutor**: A chatbot to help with basic course-related queries or administrative tasks.
2. **Virtual Study Groups**: Facilitate and automate the formation of study groups based on availability and study preferences.
3. **Peer Review**: An option for students to upload their work for peer review before submitting.
4. **Voice call**: Implement a voice call feature for study groups or direct consultation with instructors.
5. **Multi-language Support**: Given your interest in Japanese, consider adding multi-language support to make the platform more inclusive.
6. **Grade Analytics Over Time**: Analytics to track individual student performance over time
