  <h2 id="my-introduction-to-software-engineering">My Introduction to Software Engineering</h2>
<p>ICS314 has given me an opportunity to learn a lot of software engineering fundamentals that are likely difficult to practice otherwise. Things such as planning and designing software structure, working in a team, and learning new frameworks and tools are invaluable skills. The actual knowledge learned is good to know, but even more important to know is bringing yourself from not understanding framework/tool to becoming fluent with it. Programming is extremely important, but a great software engineer’s breadth of knowledge needs to be very wide and I think that I need to use the student mindset constantly to learn and improve as an engineer.</p>

<p>The two topics that I believe impacted my software development skill the most are functional programming and UI (user-interface) frameworks. I will discuss these two topics and explain why I think these two topics have impacted the way that I view and solve problems solved in software development.</p>

<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that tries to solve the problem of changing state and state immutability. There is a lot of theory that goes into the functional programming paradigm, but I admit that the theoretical concepts are an area that I need to study and improve at. Throughout my time in this class, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">underscore</code> library has changed a lot of the way in which I solve programming problems. I have found that functional programming libraries have been extremely useful at filtering in an easy to understand and concise manner. Another use case for these libraries would be performing some computation for each value in a collection. This has been particularly useful when instantiating react components in a page.</p>

<p>While working on personal projects, I have experienced some difficulties in designing classes and managing the state of either a game or app. After learning about functional programming, I did some research and learned about new ways to write code where it is more difficult for state to change unexpectedly. One appealing concept in functional programming is the idea that functions should always return the same output if given the same input. I have attempted to use some functional programming techniques while developing an RPG game because many systems in RPGs are quite complex and debugging becomes easier this way.</p>

<p>The way in which I look at data types has changed as well because the concept of taking a data type and using functional programming techniques to construct a new data type as a wrapper to create new behavior is very interesting to me.</p>

<h2 id="user-interfaces-and-ui-frameworks">User Interfaces and UI Frameworks</h2>
<p>User interfaces are quite complex. In many modern apps, if you were to use graph theory to represent all the ways in which you could navigate to a specific window or page given a user’s permission, it would be a mess. User interfaces should be fast for a developer or designer to whip up because user interfaces should be able to be modified a lot. I learned a lot in this class about user interface frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind, but one thing that I am taking to all other aspects software development that has a user interface is understanding how the user will interact with the app. Polishing up an interface and making an app easy to use is surprisingly a very important aspect to development that I keep in mind now.</p>

<p>I consider frameworks such as Bootstrap to be very easy to learn and it  takes some time to get used to it. Another thing that I take some inspiration from is the way in which the UI frameworks are designed. I like the composability of all the CSS classes and styles and it goes to show how amazing composition is in software. The acronyms and styling can get cryptic at times, but I think it is a fine solution to the very difficult problem of designing a UI.</p>
