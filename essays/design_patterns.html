  <h1 class="display-4">Design Patterns</h1>
  <span class="date">30 Nov 2023</span>
  <hr>
  <p>Design patterns are software patterns that solve a commonly encountered problem. I won’t go into extreme detail about many design patterns and instead I want to discuss when to look to design patterns and why it’s good to understand the most common ones.</p>

<h3 id="introducing-design-patterns">Introducing Design Patterns</h3>
<p>There are three main design patterns: behavioral, structural, and creational. For example, the strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows for easily swapping out predefined algorithms or behavior interchangeably. For example, when you press Ctrl+S in a fully featured text editor, you might want to select all the text instead of saving. In the text editor’s settings, you might swap out Ctrl+S from the action of saving the file for selecting all the text in the file.</p>

<p>Many design patterns introduce complexity to your software and it’s always best to make sure that you carefully choose a good fit for your software design problems.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-use-design-patterns">When to Use Design Patterns</h3>
<p>Because I encountered the use of design patterns most in my game development experience, I will use it as an example. The first time I was introduced to design patterns, I tried to use them everywhere that I thought it was possible and learned that most of the time it overcomplicated the codebase significantly. It was a good learning experience and I would recommend for everyone to apply new concepts as much as possible even if you think it might fail. However, I found that what worked best for me was to draft out a working prototype of something that works, and pay attention to patterns or problems that I run into along the way. Most of the time, the problem will make itself clear as you move forward and that might be a signal that you need a more robust solution.</p>

<h3 id="my-experience-with-design-patterns">My Experience with Design Patterns</h3>

<p>While working on a dungeon crawler project of mine, I found that creating an RPG turn based battle with a good amount of complexity needs a robust system for drafting out and adding new abilities and moves. I found through some research that using the composite pattern worked best. Most RPG games have abilities that are composed of effects such as a damage effect, healing effect, or status effect. I used this pattern to easily create and design new abilities for characters to use without having to manually write a separate class for each one which would have been hell.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-prematurely-using-a-design-pattern">Avoid Prematurely Using a Design Pattern</h3>
<p>The biggest waste of time I have experienced was trying to implement a design pattern into my dungeon crawler game and realizing I either don’t need it, or it doesn’t actually solve the problem I needed it to solve. All that pain could have been avoided by using the basics to solve the problem so that I can see extremely clearly exactly what I would need to solve the problem.</p>
